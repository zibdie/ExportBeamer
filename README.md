# ExportBeamer

## Export your posts easily from Beamer (getbeamer.com)

Beamer makes it incredibly difficult to export your announcements in a neat and clean matter, this script should make the process simple and easy.

You will need:

- API Key of your Beamer account [can be found at https://app.getbeamer.com/settings#api ]
- Python 3.9+ [most likely will work on lower versions but not tested]
